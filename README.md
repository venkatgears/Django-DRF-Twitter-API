A Django rest framework API using the twitter API to get user profile and store them in a database.
This API is a backend for a react app that I am working on.
Will be adding more features to this API in the future.

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

add your twitter API keys to the .env file

```
TWITTER_SECRET_KEY= "your_consumer_key"
```

run the server

```
python manage.py runserver
```
